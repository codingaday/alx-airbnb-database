--Identifying Inefficiencies
--ðŸš¨ 1. Seq Scan on large tables (bad sign)
--If the plan shows:


-- -> Seq Scan on booking b
--That means PostgreSQL is scanning the entire table.

--Why it happens: There's no usable index on user_id, property_id, or booking_id.

âœ… Fix it:


CREATE INDEX idx_booking_user_id ON booking(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_booking_property_id ON booking(property_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_booking_id ON booking(booking_id); -- For LEFT JOIN
Also:


CREATE INDEX idx_payment_booking_id ON payment(booking_id);



--  2. Sort step taking time

Sort  (cost=... rows=... width=...) 
Sort Key: b.start_date DESC
If Sort is expensive, add an index:


CREATE INDEX idx_booking_start_date_desc ON booking(start_date DESC);
This helps PostgreSQL avoid expensive in-memory sorts for large datasets.

--  3. Hash Join vs Nested Loop vs Merge Join
Hash Join is good for large sets, but if data is small and joins are predictable, a Nested Loop might be faster.

-- Make sure you're analyzing cardinality:

-- Does estimated rows match actual rows?

-- If not, your planner stats might be out of date â†’ ANALYZE booking;




| Symptom                   | Fix                              |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Seq Scan on joined tables | Add indexes on joined columns    |
| Expensive Sort            | Index the ORDER BY column(s)     |
| High Execution Time       | Update planner stats (`ANALYZE`) |
| Poor row estimates        | Run `VACUUM ANALYZE` regularly   |
